# Tips and trips

- If you're using your phone in a different language than the one you're translating to, it's good practice to switch it to the language that you want translate to. That gives you a better feel of the appropriate terminology.
- Also a good help is using VoiceOver on your device, which allows reading out screen content. On iOS go to the Settings App => General => Accessibility => Accessibility Shortcut (at the bottom) => Voice Over, then you can enable/disable VoiceOver by triple-tapping the home button.
